Files in this directory contain sample inputs that are used by the TestSuite
to check correctness of QuantumGEP and Evendim.
These files can also be used as examples to build new inputs.
The files named starting with matrix are the Hamiltonian in the computational
basis, with the number indicating to which test they belong to.
The files named starting with vector are the initial vectors in the computational
basis,  with the number indicating to which test they belong to.
The files named starting with graph are IsingGraphs,  with the number indicating to which test they belong to.
These vectors, matrices, graphs files may be used in more than one test.
The computational basis is the basis with each decimal number assumed in binary representation.
The basis may not be the computational basis, if Basis= is given in the input file
to indicate another basis.

A list of each input follows. See the descriptions at the start of each input.
